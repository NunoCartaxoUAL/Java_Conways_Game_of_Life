plan:
Object Oriented Programming with java Swing GUI that plays Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life:

A grid of Cells that can be Dead or Alive that interact with its neighbors to know if it stays alive or dead.

Rules:
1 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

2 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
